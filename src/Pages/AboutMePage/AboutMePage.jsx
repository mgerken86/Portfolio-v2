                    "A Software Engineer experienced in the full Software Development Life Cycle, from ideation to design to development to maintenance. Committed to writing maintainable code to implement software solutions and improve a productâ€™s functionality. Adept at working in team environments to participate in quality assurance activities. Possessing a love for software development, a technical foundation, and a passion for knowledge that expedites the learning of new technologies.
                    <br /><br />I love riddles, puzzles, and problem-solving (ask me about escape-room boxes!). Programming provides the critical thinking that I love, it feels like the closest thing to magic to me; through the power of my mind, I'm able to translate my knowledge of computer languages into a manifestation of my imagination. 
                    <br /><br />As a climber, I enjoy breaking large problems into smaller 'moves' and calculating the most efficient way of linking them together. I'm inspired by challenge and feel the highest sense of accomplishment from climbs that sometimes take years of pushing my mental and physical limits until I reach the top. I get a similar sense of joy from debugging, and most importantly, I am not afraid to fall a thousand times until I find a solution."
